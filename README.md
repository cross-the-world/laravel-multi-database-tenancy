## About Laravel Multi Database Tenancy

This is a multi-tenant web application, built in Laravel framework with support for separate databases and storage for each tenant. To take the pain out of developing multi-tenant web applications, we have extended the Laravel framework basic features, such as:

- Routing by adding a `tenant` route file under routes.
- Isolated back-end (database) and storage for each tenant.
- Bulk and isolated schema migrations and seeding for tenants.
- Expressive, intuitive database ORM to reflect the correct tenant.
- Caching, via extending the `cache` manager to handle tenant caching to speed up fetching of records.

The project is accessible to build powerful large, robust applications.
